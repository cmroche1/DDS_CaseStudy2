## Case Study Two
### Analysis of attrition and monthly income
This repository contains the artifacts created from a study of employee data. The primary goals were to help predict employee turnover (attrition) and to create a linear regression model to predict monthly salary for the provided employee data. A K Nearest Neighbor model was used to classify attrition.
